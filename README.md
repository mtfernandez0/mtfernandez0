### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third year Computer Science student who have developed a strong passion for Java backend development.
Building personal projects, I've aquired experience working with Spring, Hibernate and other related technologies.
<br />
I'm currently building a small chat for gamers with SpringBoot, SQL and other frameworks.
You can check the app here: https://github.com/mtfernandez0/GameChat
<br />
I'm deepening my knowledge in the Spring Framework and the STOMP protocol and I'm learning about design patterns.
You can find me in Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/matias-fernandez-383b19215/
